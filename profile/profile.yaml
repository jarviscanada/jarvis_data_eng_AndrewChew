summary: I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a background in software development, data analytics, and have over 5 years of customer service experience. I am highly adaptive to new environments and always looking for opportunities to enhance my capabilities. Currently, I am working as a Junior Software and Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting Group where I work with my team in an agile environment to deliver high quality software products. I believe that the software industry is moving at a incredibly rapid pace with new innovations and technologies being discovered every day. I am excited to pursue my two biggest passions in software and data engineering to join this ever evolving community, utilizing big data to build products to make the world a better and infinitely more interesting place.
