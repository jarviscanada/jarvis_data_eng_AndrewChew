# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto (CS) with a background in software development and data analytics. I am highly adaptive to new environments and always looking for opportunities to enhance my capabilities. Currently, I am working as a Junior Software and Data Engineer at Jarvis where I work with my team in an agile environment to deliver high-quality software products. During my university education, I was able to develop crucial leadership and teamworking skills through numerous development projects. I also have experience organizing and leading projects through my work as an events coordinator at Hope United Church. My five years of experience at Loblaws has also taught me important communication skills that are necessary when working in a diverse environment as well as in conflict resolution situations. I am excited to leverage my capabilities to pursue my two biggest passions in software and data engineering, utilizing big data in designing products that make the world a better and infinitely more interesting place.
